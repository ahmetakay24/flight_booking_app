# Flight Booking App

A Swift-based mobile application for booking flights, designed using the MVVM architecture pattern. The app integrates with a RESTful API for flight data and uses UIKit to handle the user interface. It is a fully functional project that demonstrates modern iOS development practices, including API integration, state management, and clean architecture.

> **Note:** This project is still under development. Some features may be incomplete or subject to change.
